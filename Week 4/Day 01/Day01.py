# Example: Defining Machine Learning
print("Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.")

# Supervised Learning
print("Supervised Learning: Training a model on labeled data.")

# Unsupervised Learning
print("Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data.")

# Reinforcement Learning
print("Reinforcement Learning: Training a model to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones.")
