## Project: Model Deployment using Azure

### Overview:
In this project, you will deploy a machine learning model as a web service using Azure App Service. This project includes steps to prepare the model, create an API for the model, and deploy it to Azure.

### Step 1: Train and Save the Model
First, you need to have a trained machine learning model. For this example, we'll assume that you have trained a simple classifier using scikit-learn.

**Code: Train and Save the Model**
```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')
```

**Documentation:**
- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset is used for this classification example. It contains features of iris flowers and their corresponding species.
- **Model:** A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the dataset.
- **Output:** The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file, which will be deployed later.

### Step 2: Create a Flask API for the Model
Next, you will create a Flask application that loads the saved model and provides a REST API to make predictions.

**Code: Create Flask API**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get data from the request
    data = request.json
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**Documentation:**
- **Flask API:** This simple Flask app exposes a `/predict` endpoint. The endpoint accepts a JSON payload with features and returns a prediction from the model.
- **Method:** The endpoint uses a POST request method to accept data for prediction.

### Step 3: Test the API Locally
Before deploying the API to Azure, you should test it locally to ensure it works as expected.

**Code: Test the API Locally**
```python
import requests

# Example features for prediction
data = {
    "features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]  # Example data point from the Iris dataset
}

# Make a POST request to the local Flask API
response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict', json=data)
print("Prediction:", response.json())
```

**Documentation:**
- **Testing:** This script sends a test request to the local Flask API to ensure it returns a prediction correctly.

### Step 4: Deploy the API to Azure App Service
Now that the API works locally, you can deploy it to Azure App Service.

**Step 4.1: Create Azure App Service**
1. **Login to Azure Portal:** Go to https://portal.azure.com.
2. **Create a Resource:** Click on "Create a resource" and select "App Service."
3. **Configure App Service:**
   - **Resource Group:** Create a new or select an existing resource group.
   - **Name:** Give your app a unique name.
   - **Runtime Stack:** Choose "Python 3.8" or any compatible version.
   - **Region:** Select a region close to your users.

4. **Deploy the App:**
   - **Deployment Method:** Choose your preferred deployment method, such as GitHub, Azure DevOps, or local Git.
   - **Deploy:** Push your code to the selected method.

**Step 4.2: Deploy via Azure CLI**
Alternatively, you can deploy using the Azure CLI.

**Code: Azure CLI Deployment**
```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Create a resource group (if not already created)
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create an App Service plan
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku FREE

# Create the Web App
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name myFlaskApp

# Deploy the Flask app
az webapp up --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myFlaskApp --runtime "PYTHON|3.8"
```

**Documentation:**
- **Azure App Service:** A platform for deploying web apps. This step involves creating a resource group, App Service plan, and the web app itself, followed by deploying the app using Azure CLI.
  
### Step 5: Test the Deployed API
Once the API is deployed, you can test it by making requests to the Azure-hosted API endpoint.

**Code: Test Deployed API**
```python
import requests

# Example features for prediction
data = {
    "features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]
}

# Replace <your-app-name> with the name of your deployed app
response = requests.post('https://<your-app-name>.azurewebsites.net/predict', json=data)
print("Prediction:", response.json())
```

**Documentation:**
- **Testing:** This code sends a request to the deployed API on Azure and returns the prediction.

### Step 6: Monitor and Scale the App
After deploying, you may want to monitor the app's performance and scale it if necessary.

**Monitoring:**
- Use **Azure Application Insights** to monitor the app's performance and detect any issues.
- **Azure Metrics:** Check metrics like CPU usage, memory, and request count.

**Scaling:**
- **Scaling Out:** Increase the number of instances to handle more traffic.
- **Scaling Up:** Increase the resources (e.g., CPU, memory) of the current instance.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrated how to deploy a machine learning model as a web service using Azure App Service. By following these steps, you can easily scale and monitor your application to handle real-world scenarios. This approach allows you to provide predictions via a simple API, making your machine learning model accessible to other applications or users.
