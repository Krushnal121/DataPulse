# Import necessary libraries
import spacy

# Section 1: Entity Recognition
"""
Entity recognition involves identifying entities such as names, organizations, dates, etc., within a text.
In this section, we use SpaCy to perform entity recognition.
"""

# Load SpaCy model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Sample text for entity recognition
text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"

# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)

# Print identified entities
print("Entities in the text:")
for entity in doc.ents:
    print(entity.text, entity.label_)

# Section 2: Sentiment Analysis
"""
Sentiment analysis is used to determine the sentiment of a given text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
In this section, we use TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of a sample text.
"""

# Sample text for sentiment analysis
text = "I love this product! It works wonderfully."

# Analyze sentiment using TextBlob
blob = TextBlob(text)
sentiment = blob.sentiment
print(f"\nSentiment Analysis Result: {sentiment}")

# Section 3: Question Answering
"""
Question answering systems can answer questions based on given context. Here, we use the transformers library
to build a simple QA system.
"""

# Load pre-trained model for question answering
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")

# Sample context and question
context = "The capital of France is Paris."
question = "What is the capital of France?"

# Get the answer
result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
print(f"\nQuestion Answering Result: {result['answer']}")

# Section 4: Anomaly Detection
"""
Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying unusual patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.
In this section, we use the IsolationForest model from Scikit-learn to detect anomalies in a sample dataset.
"""

# Sample data for anomaly detection
data = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [8, 8], [10, 10]]

# Fit IsolationForest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.2)
model.fit(data)

# Predict anomalies
predictions = model.predict(data)
print(f"\nAnomaly Detection Predictions: {predictions}")

# Section 5: Custom Vision Model Development
"""
In this section, we demonstrate how to develop a custom vision model using Azure Custom Vision to classify images
into specific categories based on a custom dataset.
"""

# Example code for Azure Custom Vision setup (pseudo-code)
"""

# Print the results
for prediction in results.predictions:
    print(f"\nCustom Vision Prediction: {prediction.tag_name}: {prediction.probability * 100:.2f}%")
"""

# Section 6: Image Analysis using OpenCV
"""
Here, we analyze an image of a natural landscape using OpenCV by calculating and plotting histograms of the RGB channels.
"""

# Load an image using OpenCV
image = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')

# Check if image is loaded successfully
if image is None:
    raise FileNotFoundError("The image file was not found.")

# Convert the image from BGR to RGB
image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Calculate histograms for each color channel
colors = ('r', 'g', 'b')
for i, color in enumerate(colors):
    histogram = cv2.calcHist([image_rgb], [i], None, [256], [0, 256])
    plt.plot(histogram, color=color)

# Set up the plot
plt.title("Histogram for Color Channels")
plt.xlabel("Pixel Value")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.legend(colors)
plt.show()
